A simple, responsive To-Do List application built with React and Material-UI, featuring the ability to add, complete, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved in local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

- **Toggle task completion** to mark tasks as done or undone.
- **Delete tasks** you no longer need on your list.
- **Persist data** in the browser's local storage, so your to-do list is saved between sessions.
